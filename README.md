# Ethical Hacking Scripts

This repository contains some Python scripts that can be used for ethical hacking purposes. The scripts included in this repository are:

-   `Mac_Changer.py`: This script can be used to change the MAC address of a network interface card (NIC).
-   `Network_Scanner.py`: This script can be used to scan a network and find all the connected devices.
-   `Packet_Sniffer.py`: This script can be used to sniff network traffic and extract useful information from it.
-   `arp_spoof.py`: This script can be used to perform ARP spoofing attacks.

## Prerequisites

In order to run these scripts, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You also need to have the following Python modules installed:

-   `scapy`
-   `argparse`

## Usage

Before running any of the scripts, you need to manually edit the content of the files and place the target IP in order to work if required. You can do this by opening the script file in a text editor and modifying the appropriate variables.

To run a script, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then run the script using the following command:

php

`python <script_name>.py`

For example, to run the `Mac_Changer.py` script, you would run the following command:

`python Mac_Changer.py`
